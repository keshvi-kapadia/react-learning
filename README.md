This repository documents my journey of learning React step by step.
[View Demo](https://react-learning-rho-mauve.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 What I have built so far
- Reusable React components
- Passing data using props
- State management with useState
- Event handling (click, input change)
- Conditional rendering (show/hide UI)
- Rendering dynamic lists using map()
- Parent → child communication
- Deleting items from state
- Click counters per component
- Adding new items using controlled inputs

## 📌 Current Mini Project
A simple **Employee Manager** that allows:
- Adding new employees using an input field
- Showing / hiding the employee list
- Incrementing & resetting click count per employee
- Deleting employees dynamically
- Handling empty list scenarios

## 🎯 Goal
To build strong React fundamentals by practicing daily and gradually creating real-world features.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

🌸 Learning in progress — one day at a time.
